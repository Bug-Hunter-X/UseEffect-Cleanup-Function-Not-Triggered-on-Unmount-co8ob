# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with React's `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function doesn't seem to be executed when the component unmounts.  The example shows how to correctly use the cleanup function in `useEffect` to ensure that resources are released properly when the component is no longer needed.
